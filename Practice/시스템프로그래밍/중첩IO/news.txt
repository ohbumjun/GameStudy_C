Twelve of China's top Covid testing firms have recently posted huge increases in both revenues and net profits for the first half of this year.
Andon Health, which supplies Covid test kits both at home and abroad, reported that its net profit skyrocketed by 27,728% in the first six months of 2022, reaching 15.24 billion yuan ($2.2 billion). It was the biggest increase recorded by any listed company in mainland China.
Meanwhile, its revenue surged 3,989%.
The company benefits not only from China's aggressive testing campaign at home, but also from huge demand in the United States, as its iHealth Lab had recently won US government contracts for supplying antigen rapid tests.
Assure Tech, a Hangzhou-based diagnostic firm, also posted a 1,324% increase in net income because of strong demand in the global Covid testing market.
